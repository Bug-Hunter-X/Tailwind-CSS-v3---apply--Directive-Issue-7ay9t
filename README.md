# Tailwind CSS v3 `@apply` Directive Issue
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when upgrading to Tailwind CSS v3: the use of the deprecated `@apply` directive.

The `bug.html` file shows the problematic code using `@apply`. The `bugSolution.html` file provides the updated code using the recommended approach of directly applying utility classes.

## Solution
Replace the deprecated `@apply` directive with the direct application of Tailwind utility classes.  This improves performance and maintainability.
